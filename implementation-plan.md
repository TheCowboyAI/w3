# W3 Memory Bank Implementation Plan

## Current State Assessment
- Basic app structure is set up using Leptos 0.7.8 (upgraded from 0.7.0)
- Typography and Card components exist with some linter errors addressed
- Home page is operational with basic styling
- Component showcase page has been implemented

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Fix Linter Errors and Component Organization
- [x] Address showcase component issues:
  - [x] Update Leptos components to be compatible with version 0.7.8
  - [x] Remove showcase components and implement them differently
  - [x] Create a basic component test page for development

- [ ] Organize component imports:
  - [x] Ensure components/mod.rs exports all components properly
  - [ ] Create hierarchical component structure for better organization

### Phase 1.5: Fix String Handling and JSX Issues
- [x] Fix Button component issues:
  - [x] Add `Text` variant to ButtonVariant
  - [x] Update ButtonShowcase component
- [ ] Address string-related linter errors:
  - [ ] Standardize approach to handling String vs &str in props
  - [ ] Fix apostrophe issues in text content
  - [ ] Resolve JSX comment syntax issues in view! macro

### Phase 2: Enhance Core Components
- [ ] Create main layout component with proper styling
- [ ] Implement navigation component
- [ ] Create memory item component for displaying memory entries
- [ ] Develop form components for memory input

### Phase 3: Build Core Pages
- [ ] Enhance Home page with proper layout and components
- [ ] Create Memory Viewer page
- [ ] Implement Memory Entry page
- [ ] Add Settings page

### Phase 4: State Management & Data Flow
- [ ] Implement memory data structures
- [ ] Create memory storage and retrieval system
- [ ] Set up state management for user preferences

### Phase 5: Polish & Integration
- [ ] Apply consistent styling across all pages
- [ ] Add responsive design adaptations
- [ ] Implement animations and transitions
- [ ] Accessibility audit and improvements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Revised Approach for Components
Successfully implemented a simpler approach to the component showcase:

1. ‚úÖ Removed the showcase components from the main component files
2. ‚úÖ Created a separate showcase page in the application for component testing
3. ‚úÖ Implemented showcase components with simpler structures

```rust
// In pages/component_showcase.rs
#[component]
pub fn ComponentShowcase() -> impl IntoView {
    view! {
        <div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-16 space-y-16">
            {/* Typography Section */}
            <section class="mb-16">
                <Heading1 class="mb-8".to_string()>
                    Typography
                </Heading1>
                
                <div class="space-y-6">
                    // Examples of typography components...
                </div>
            </section>
            
            {/* Other sections... */}
        </div>
    }
}
```

### Component Organization
Create a better component organization structure:

```rust
// In components/mod.rs - Current structure
// Core UI components
pub mod typography;
pub mod card;
pub mod button; 
pub mod theme;
pub mod counter_btn;
pub mod layout;
pub mod navigation;

// Re-exports for easier imports
pub use typography::*;
pub use card::*;
pub use button::*;
pub use theme::*;
pub use counter_btn::CounterButton;
pub use layout::MainLayout;
pub use navigation::Navigation;
```

### Home Page Enhancement
The Home page has been improved but still needs further refinement:

```rust
#[component]
pub fn Home() -> impl IntoView {
    view! {
        <div class="min-h-screen bg-background">
            <header>...</header>
            <main>
                <section>
                    // Hero section...
                </section>
                <section>
                    // Features section...
                </section>
                <section>
                    // Tech stack section...
                </section>
            </main>
            <footer>...</footer>
        </div>
    }
}
```

## Development Approach
1. ‚úÖ Removed problematic showcase components
2. ‚úÖ Implemented a dedicated showcase page for testing components
3. üîÑ Build main components and pages (in progress)
4. ‚è≥ Add state management (planned)
5. ‚è≥ Polish and refine (planned)

## Testing Strategy
- ‚úÖ Test components individually on the showcase page
- üîÑ Verify page rendering with simpler components (in progress)
- ‚è≥ Test state management with mock data (planned)
- ‚è≥ Validate responsive design (planned)

## Dependencies
- Leptos 0.7.8 for UI framework (updated)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
