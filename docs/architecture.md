# Architecture
This website uses Leptos CSR to provide a solid, modern ecosystem in Rust using WebAssembly, TailwindCSS and access to a Nats Server for messagging (server not included in this project)

It functions as the First Impression of Cowboy AI and should show off some of our AI Expertise, while staying minimal in it's actual functionality.

We need a few submission forms and those should operate exclusively from Cowboy AI Controlled Mail Servers.

Asthetically the site should allow limited QA, aka a chatbot for asking about Cowboy AI, while at the same time providing a resource of architectural information and tooling that makes Cowboy AI Uniqiue.

We want a STRIKING landing page that allows for animation and interaction.
