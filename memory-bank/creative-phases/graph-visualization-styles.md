# Graph Visualization Styles - Creative Phase

ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: UI/UX DESIGN ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨
Focus: Graph Visualization System
Objective: Design a comprehensive graph visualization system that renders network data with intuitive interactions and appropriate animations
Requirements:
- Must work seamlessly and intuitively for users
- Must support subtle animations for state changes (movement, rearrangement)
- Must enable richer animations for front page/showcase content
- Must be implemented in Rust with Leptos without JavaScript dependencies
- Must perform well with complex graphs
- Must integrate with the established design system and animation patterns

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The project requires a sophisticated graph visualization system that can display various types of connected data while providing intuitive interaction and appropriate animation. The system must be implemented entirely in Rust with Leptos, avoiding JavaScript dependencies, while maintaining high performance even for complex graphs. The visualization must also align with the established futuristic cybernetic design aesthetic and animation patterns.

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Leptos + WebGL via wasm-bindgen

- More complex than SVG for styling
- Limited visual effects compared to WebGL

**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: Medium

### Option 4: Hybrid SVG + Canvas Approach
**Description**: Use SVG for UI elements and interaction, and Canvas for rendering the graph itself, combining the benefits of both approaches.

**Pros**:
- Leverages strengths of both SVG and Canvas
- Better performance than pure SVG for larger graphs
- Easier UI integration than pure Canvas
- Good balance of performance and developer experience
- Can progressively enhance with WebGL for complex visualizations

**Cons**:
- More complex architecture with dual rendering systems
- Requires careful coordination between SVG and Canvas elements
- Potential performance overhead from maintaining two systems
- More complexity in animation coordination

**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Implementation Time**: Medium-High

## DECISION

After evaluating all options, we recommend **Option 4: Hybrid SVG + Canvas Approach** for the following reasons:

1. It balances performance needs with implementation complexity
2. It allows for using our existing SVG animation patterns
3. It provides better performance than pure SVG for larger graphs
4. It maintains ease of styling and interactivity through SVG elements
5. It supports progressive enhancement for more complex visualizations
6. It aligns well with our existing animation pattern document

This approach will allow us to create intuitive and performant graph visualizations that work well for both subtle animations and more elaborate front page displays, while maintaining a pure Rust implementation.

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### 1. Core Graph Model

Define a core graph data structure in Rust:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct GraphNode {
    id: String,
    label: String,
    node_type: String,
    position: (f64, f64),
    data: HashMap<String, String>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct GraphEdge {
    id: String,
    source: String,
    target: String,
    edge_type: String,
    weight: Option<f64>,
    data: HashMap<String, String>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct Graph {
    nodes: Vec<GraphNode>,
    edges: Vec<GraphEdge>,
    directed: bool,
}
```

### 2. Rendering System Architecture

Create a layered rendering system:

```rust
// Canvas Layer for graph rendering
#[component]
pub fn GraphCanvas(graph: Graph, config: GraphConfig) -> impl IntoView {
    // Canvas setup and render logic
}

// SVG Layer for interactive elements
#[component]
pub fn GraphSvgOverlay(graph: Graph, config: GraphConfig, on_node_click: Callback<String>) -> impl IntoView {
    // SVG overlay for interactive elements
}

// Combined Graph Visualization component
#[component]
pub fn GraphVisualizer(
    #[prop(default = Graph::default())] graph: Graph,
    #[prop(default = GraphConfig::default())] config: GraphConfig,
    #[prop(default = None)] on_node_click: Option<Callback<String>>,
    #[prop(default = None)] on_edge_click: Option<Callback<String>>,
) -> impl IntoView {
    view! {
        <div class="graph-container relative">
            <GraphCanvas graph=graph.clone() config=config.clone() />
            <GraphSvgOverlay 
                graph=graph 
                config=config 
                on_node_click=on_node_click.unwrap_or_default() 
            />
        </div>
    }
}
```

### 3. Layout Algorithms

Implement force-directed graph layout algorithms in Rust:

```rust
pub struct ForceDirectedLayout {
    repulsion: f64,
    attraction: f64,
    damping: f64,
    max_iterations: usize,
}

impl ForceDirectedLayout {
    pub fn new(repulsion: f64, attraction: f64, damping: f64, max_iterations: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            repulsion,
            attraction,
            damping,
            max_iterations,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn apply(&self, graph: &mut Graph) {
        // Force-directed layout implementation
        // Calculate repulsive forces between nodes
        // Calculate attractive forces along edges
        // Update node positions with damping
        // Repeat for max_iterations or until stability
    }
}

// Additional layout algorithms
pub struct CircularLayout;
pub struct HierarchicalLayout;
pub struct GridLayout;
```

### 4. Animation Integration

Integrate with the established animation patterns:

```rust
// Animation configuration
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct GraphAnimationConfig {
    enabled: bool,
    duration: u32, // in milliseconds
    easing: String, // e.g., "ease-standard", "ease-bounce"
    stagger: bool,
    stagger_delay: u32,
}

// Animated graph transitions
pub fn animate_graph_transition(
    graph: &Graph,
    new_graph: &Graph,
    animation_config: &GraphAnimationConfig,
) -> Vec<KeyframeEffect> {
    // Create animation keyframes for transitioning between graph states
    // Return animation effects to be applied to nodes and edges
}
```

### 5. Interaction Handlers

Implement interaction handlers for graph elements:

```rust
#[component]
pub fn NodeInteraction(
    node: GraphNode,
    selected: ReadSignal<Option<String>>,
    set_selected: WriteSignal<Option<String>>,
) -> impl IntoView {
    let node_id = node.id.clone();
    
    let is_selected = move || selected.get().map_or(false, |id| id == node_id);
    
    let on_click = move |_| {
        set_selected.update(|current| {
            if current.as_ref().map_or(false, |id| id == &node_id) {
                None // Deselect if already selected
            } else {
                Some(node_id.clone()) // Select this node
            }
        });
    };
    
    view! {
        <g 
            class=move || format!("graph-node {} {}", 
                if is_selected() { "selected" } else { "" },
                node.node_type
            )
            on:click=on_click
        >
            // Node visual elements
        </g>
    }
}
```

### 6. Custom Visual Styles

Define graph element visual styles aligned with the design system:

```scss
// Graph node styles
.graph-node {
  @apply transition-all duration-standard ease-standard;
  
  &:hover {
    @apply scale-110 shadow-[0_0_8px_2px_#009CFF];
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
  }
  
  &.selected {
    @apply animate-pulse shadow-[0_0_12px_4px_#009CFF];
  }
  
  // Node type variations
  &.data-node {
    @apply fill-blue-500 stroke-blue-300 stroke-[2px];
  }
  
  &.concept-node {
    @apply fill-violet-500 stroke-violet-300 stroke-[2px];
  }
  
  &.system-node {
    @apply fill-emerald-500 stroke-emerald-300 stroke-[2px];
  }
}

// Graph edge styles
.graph-edge {
  @apply transition-all duration-standard ease-standard stroke-[2px] opacity-60;
  
  &:hover {
    @apply stroke-width-[3px] opacity-100 shadow-[0_0_5px_1px_#009CFF];
  }
  
  &.selected {
    @apply stroke-width-[3px] opacity-100 shadow-[0_0_8px_2px_#009CFF];
  }
  
  // Edge type variations
  &.relation-edge {
    @apply stroke-blue-400;
  }
  
  &.dependency-edge {
    @apply stroke-amber-400 stroke-dasharray-[5,3];
  }
  
  &.flow-edge {
    @apply stroke-emerald-400;
  }
}
```

### 7. Performance Optimizations

Implement performance optimizations:

```rust
// Level of Detail management
pub fn apply_lod(graph: &Graph, zoom_level: f64) -> Graph {
    if zoom_level < 0.5 {
        // At far zoom levels, simplify the graph
        simplify_graph(graph, 0.3)
    } else if zoom_level < 0.8 {
        // At medium zoom levels, moderate detail
        simplify_graph(graph, 0.6)
    } else {
        // At close zoom levels, full detail
        graph.clone()
    }
}

// Spatial partitioning for large graphs
pub struct QuadTree {
    // Quadtree implementation for spatial queries
}

impl QuadTree {
    pub fn new(nodes: &[GraphNode], bounds: (f64, f64, f64, f64)) -> Self {
        // Initialize quadtree with nodes
    }
    
    pub fn query_visible(&self, viewport: (f64, f64, f64, f64)) -> Vec<&GraphNode> {
        // Return only nodes visible in the current viewport
    }
}
```

### 8. Front Page Enhanced Visualizations

For richer front page animations, create specialized components:

```rust
#[component]
pub fn FrontPageGraphAnimation() -> impl IntoView {
    let (graph, set_graph) = create_signal(Graph::default());
    
    // Animation sequences for front page
    let sequences = vec![
        GraphAnimationSequence {
            duration: 2000,
            transform: Box::new(|g| expand_graph(g)),
        },
        GraphAnimationSequence {
            duration: 1500,
            transform: Box::new(|g| highlight_paths(g)),
        },
        GraphAnimationSequence {
            duration: 2500,
            transform: Box::new(|g| cluster_graph(g)),
        },
    ];
    
    // Run sequences
    create_effect(move |_| {
        run_animation_sequences(sequences, set_graph);
    });
    
    view! {
        <div class="front-page-visualization">
            <GraphVisualizer 
                graph=graph
                config=GraphConfig {
                    enhanced_effects: true,
                    animation_duration: 800,
                    ..GraphConfig::default()
                }
            />
        </div>
    }
}
```

## ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS

To ensure the graph visualization is accessible:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Implement arrow key navigation between nodes
   - Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Ensure focus indicators are visible

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Add proper ARIA attributes to graph elements
   - Provide textual alternatives for graph structures
   - Include a table view option for data

3. **Color and Contrast**
   - Ensure sufficient contrast for all graph elements
   - Don't rely solely on color for conveying information
   - Provide a high contrast mode option

4. **Motion Sensitivity**
   - Honor the prefers-reduced-motion setting
   - Provide controls to pause or disable animations
   - Keep animations subtle and purposeful

## PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

To maintain optimal performance:

1. **Rendering Optimizations**
   - Implement level-of-detail rendering based on zoom level
   - Use spatial partitioning (quadtree) for large graphs
   - Only render nodes and edges within the viewport

2. **Animation Efficiency**
   - Limit animations to necessary elements
   - Use efficient properties for animation (transform, opacity)
   - Throttle animations during user interaction

3. **Memory Management**
   - Efficiently reuse graph elements when possible
   - Implement proper cleanup for removed elements
   - Monitor and optimize memory usage for large graphs
