## NixOS Foundation Rules
1. **Always start with Nix flake**  
we prefer a template from @https://github.com/thecowboyai/flake-templates

make a .envrc file to support direnv.

always check the linter and fix and errors or warnings
use nix flake check to verify any flake.nix files before offering suggested syntax

use nixos-latest-stable unless unstable is specified in the documentation
MINIMUM NIXOS VERSION IS 24.11

ALWAYS make MODULARIZED Flakes, where we separate .nix modules logically.
DO NOT USE FLAKE-PARTS
DO NOT USE FLAKE-UTILS
USE PURE NIX SYNTAX, avoid anything that will cause us to use the --impure flag

put the devshell in /modules/shells/devshell.nix
put nixos modules in /modules/nixos
put home-manager modules in /modules/hm
put nix lists such as packages in /modules/lists
put nix attribute-sets such as options in /modules/sets

DO NOT USE HOME-MANAGER UNLESS TOLD TO USE HOME-MANAGER INSIDE @productContext.md

flake.nix should import these rather than define them inline.

WHEN ADDING ANY FILES TO A REPO YOU MUST: `git add <filename>` immediately after adding, or after adding a batch of files, git add them all.
